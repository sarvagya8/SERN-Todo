# Small ToDo Application using SQLite3 & ERN Stack

This is a small and quick application that uses the following stack:

* SQLite3
* Express JS
* Node JS
* React JS

## Installation

The migration will happen automatically for the first time. Just run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarvagya8/SERN-Todo.git
cd SERN-Todo
```

For running the server:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Do the same thing for running the client:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

The application will use ports `3100` for server API end point and `3000` for running the client site.
